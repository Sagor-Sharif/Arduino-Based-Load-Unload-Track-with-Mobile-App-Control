Arduino-Based Load-Unload Track with Mobile App Control
The Arduino-based load-unload track is an automated system designed to move in different directions and perform loading and unloading operations. At its core, the project uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller to control DC motors connected to the wheels and an unloading mechanism. An H-Bridge motor driver (L298N) enables the vehicle to move forward, backward, left, and right, while PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) manages motor speed through enable pins. The track offers two control methods: serial communication via a PC and Bluetooth control through a mobile app. A Bluetooth module (HC-05) pairs with a smartphone, allowing users to send character commands such as ‘F’ for forward, ‘B’ for backward, ‘L’ for left, ‘R’ for right, ‘U’ for unloading forward, and ‘u’ for unloading reverse. Upon receiving commands, the Arduino activates the corresponding motor pins to perform the required actions. The unloading mechanism is controlled remotely, allowing seamless load management in both directions. After each operation, the motors reset to conserve power and prevent unnecessary movement. The mobile app provides a wireless interface, offering flexibility for users to control the system remotely. This project can be further enhanced by integrating sensors for obstacle detection or GPS tracking for advanced navigation. Ideal for warehouse automation, factory conveyor systems, and robotics education, this project demonstrates the efficient combination of motor control, Arduino programming, and Bluetooth communication, providing a practical solution for small-scale automation and a valuable learning experience for students and hobbyists.
